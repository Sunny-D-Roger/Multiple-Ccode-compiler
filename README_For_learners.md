**For those who wanna understand the code and re-write.** <br />
Start by breaking the choices into sections.          <br />
For example, for choice == '2' only try and create that much and ignore rest of choices recreate the choice == '2' and run it. <br />

Sometimes I have used except statement without any exceptions there's a simple reason for that
just try and create the code and on successful run you would understand that our code is not very complex
we don't need it to be more error prone beyond file not found, linking problem etc. so we just use bare except to simply
point that out by our print statement. <br />

I could've shorted the whole script in many functions but it's not necessary. <br />
It's easy to read this way by looking at choice number. I tried functions after <br />
completing the script but it made code more messy and hard to understand.     <br />

Well technically you can write clean and better code than me. I have spent considerable time on this code
I leave the rest upto you... and rest in peace ( not gonna die lmao) just gonna take a rest and watch anime.
